US-China Trade War: The Guns of August

   August, which is supposed to be a somnolent month, has erupted in 2019
   in a blaze of threats and tariff escalations. At times, President
   Donald Trump’s trade war with China has seemed like it was spinning out
   of control. A pivotal moment occurred August 23 when China announced
   details of its long-anticipated retaliation to Trump’s newest tariffs
--

   If the two sides follow through with their now formalized tariff plans,
   the US-China trade war will undergo a structural shift. What follows is
   an explanation of the implications of the tariffs that have been
   announced so far. Though no one can predict the future, it is worth
--

   The bottom line result is that in less than two years, Trump will have
   increased the average tariff on Chinese imports above 26 percent,
   compared to an average of only 3 percent at the onset of the trade war.
   Trump’s actions will affect nearly everything Americans purchase from
   China.

   December 15. This was unsurprising to most, given that China has
   matched the timing of each of the Trump administration’s previous
   tariff increases during the trade war.

   Overall, China’s average tariff applied to US exports will increase

   and to 25.9 percent on December 15 (figure 1). This is a sharp increase
   from the 8.0 percent average tariff that faced US exporters to access
   the Chinese market before the trade war started in January 2018. China
   has also cut its tariffs toward non-US exporters considerably over this
   same period, to a current level of 6.7 percent.

   2019, and $45.5 billion on December 15. Yet most of the tariff
   increases apply to products that China has already hit at least once
   with new tariffs during the trade war.

   The product coverage of the Chinese retaliation will increase modestly

   Shortly after China’s retaliation announcement, Trump raised the stakes
   of his trade war rhetoric in a 10:30 a.m. tweet by referring to Chinese
   President Xi as potentially an “enemy.” At 10:59 a.m. he then tweeted
   his directive that “Our great American companies are hereby ordered to

   his directive that “Our great American companies are hereby ordered to
   immediately start looking for an alternative to China.” And then just
   before midnight, Trump made one final and worrisome trade war tweet
   that signaled that he might be prepared to do even more damage to the
   US-China relationship and legally follow through with his order, “For

--
   Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977. Case closed!”

   Additional news on Trump’s trade war surfaced over the next three days
   at the Group of 7 (G-7) summit in Biarritz, France. First, Trump
   publicly stated he had second thoughts about his escalation with China.
--
--
   and China might soon return to the negotiating table.

   The purpose and next steps in Trump’s trade war remain unknown. The
   economic significance of these next tariffs in the offing are not.
