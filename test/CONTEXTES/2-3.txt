   The China–United States trade war (simplified Chinese: 中美贸易战;
   traditional Chinese: 中美貿易戰; pinyin: Zhōngměi Màoyìzhàn) is an ongoing
   economic conflict between the world’s two largest national economies,
--
--
   that escalating tariff conflicts result in no winners.^[4]^[5]^[6]^[7]

   In the United States, the trade war has brought struggles for farmers
   and manufacturers and higher prices for consumers. In other countries
   it has also caused economic damage, though some countries have
--
--
   led to stock market instability. The governments of several countries,
   including China and the United States, have taken steps to address some
   of the damage. The trade war has been criticized internationally; in
   the U.S., businesses and agricultural organizations have also been
   critical, though most farmers continued to support Trump. Among U.S.
--
--
   politicians the response has been mixed.

   The trade war has caused a significant deterioration in China–United
   States relations as the countries exchanged tit-for-tat tariffs for
   over a year, with Trump threatening more to come and no resolution in
--
--
   American economy hundreds of billions of dollars a year because of
   unfair trade practices. After imposing tariffs, he denied entering into
   a trade war, claiming the "trade war was lost many years ago by the
   foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S." He said that
   the U.S. has a trade deficit of $500 billion a year, with intellectual

   Initiating steel and aluminum tariff actions in March 2018, Trump said
   "trade wars are good, and so easy to win,"^[63] but as the conflict
   continued to escalate through August 2019, Trump stated, "I never said
   China was going to be easy."^[64]^[65]
--
--
   The Chinese government has blamed the American government for starting
   the conflict and said that U.S. actions were making negotiations
   difficult. They say the trade war has had a negative effect on the
   world and that the U.S. government's real goal is to stifle China's
   growth.^[73]

       "significantly increase" its purchases of American goods. As a
       result, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin announced that "We are
       putting the trade war on hold".^[96] White House National Trade
       Council director Peter Navarro, however, said that there was no

       Council director Peter Navarro, however, said that there was no
       "trade war," but that it was a "trade dispute, fair and simple. We
       lost the trade war long ago."^[97]
     * May 21: Trump tweeted that "China has agreed to buy massive amounts
       of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products," although he later

       July 6, 2018, with a further $16 billion to begin at a later
       date.^[102]^[103]^[104] China's Commerce Ministry accused the
       United States of launching a trade war and said China would respond
       in kind with similar tariffs for US imports, starting on July
       6.^[105] Three days later, the White House declared that the United

     * June 19: China retaliates, threatening its own tariffs on $50
       billion of U.S. goods, and stating that the United States had
       launched a trade war. Import and export markets in a number of
       nations feared the tariffs would disrupt supply chains which could
       "ripple around the globe."^[107]

       goods.^[141]
     * June 29: During the G20 Osaka summit, Trump announces he and Xi
       Jinping agreed to a "truce" in the trade war after extensive talks.
       Prior tariffs are to remain in effect, but no future tariffs are to
       be enacted "for the time being" amid restarted negotiations.
--
--
     * August 5: China ordered state-owned enterprises to stop buying US
       agricultural products,^[153] totaling $20 billion per year before
       the trade war.^[154] Zippy Duvall, president of the American Farm
       Bureau Federation, called the move "a body blow to thousands of
       farmers and ranchers who are already struggling to get by," adding,

     * September 12: Bloomberg News and Politico reported that Trump

       campaign and were discussing ways to reach a limited interim

   January and August 2019.^[189] Yet despite the negative effects, polls

   U.S. agriculture.^[190]

   Analysis conducted by the Peterson Institute for International
   Economics found that China imposed uniform tariffs averaging 8% on all
   its importers in January 2018, before the trade war began. By June
   2019, tariffs on American imports had increased to 20.7%, while tariffs
   on other nations declined to 6.7%.^[201] The analysis also found that

   frictions may further curb global economic growth and continue weaken
   the investment.^[204] According to Capital Economics, China's economic
   growth has slowed as a result of the trade war, though overall the
   Chinese economy "has held up well", and China's share of global exports
   has increased.^[205] U.S. economic growth has also slowed.^[203]

   In August 2019, Roger Johnson of the National Farmers Union —
   representing about 200,000 family farmers, ranchers and fishers —
   stated that the trade war was creating problems for American farmers,
   specifically highlighting the fall in soybean exports from the U.S. to
   China, elaborating, "instead of looking to solve existing problems in

   agriculture."^[259]
