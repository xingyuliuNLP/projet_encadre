Google co-founders stepping down from executive roles

   New York (CNN Business)This is what a trade war looks like.
   An industrial giant in Illinois, a motorcycle icon in Wisconsin, a
   Minnesota snowmobile maker and the parent of Monopoly and Nerf all
   reported to investors this week that the trade war is biting.
   It's the earnings trend everyone saw coming. And warned about.

   What began as targeted tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in early
   2018 accelerated over the past year and a half as tariff rates were
   jacked up with each disappointment in the negotiations. And now, months
   and months of those tariffs — and disrupted supply chains because of
   them — are raising costs and squeezing margins for a wide variety of
   companies.
   Think of it like this. A year ago, those tariffs were like a nasty
   cold. Irritating but temporary.

   Today, for multinational companies, the cold has become a chronic
   condition.
   "President Trump's trade war is doing significant damage to the US and
   global economies," said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's. "The
   higher tariffs act like a tax increase on businesses and their
   customers."
   If President Donald Trump follows through on his threat to raise
   tariffs again on Chinese imports in December, those tariffs would
   amount to a more-than $100 billion tax increase next year, Zandi
   calculated.
   Some executives are blaming higher costs from the tariffs directly.
   Others blame global uncertainty about how deep and how long the tariff
   regime will last.
   Industrial giant Caterpillar (CAT) reported a 6% revenue decline
   compared with last year. CEO Jim Umpleby predicted flat demand for the
   last quarter of this year.
   "We now expect end-user demand to be flat and dealers to make further
   inventory reductions due to global economic uncertainty," he said.
   Polaris (PII) makes snowmobiles, all-terrain vehicles and boats. Its
   management team has scrambled to offset the higher costs of tariffs
   through 60 different initiatives. The company has absorbed about $5
   million of tariff-related costs this year by moving to source parts
   outside of China and negotiating with suppliers, among other things,
   CEO Scott Wine said on the company's most recent earnings call.
   Harley-Davidson's (HOG) tariff trouble was a $21.6 million hit to
   third-quarter earnings, up sharply from last year. Once hailed by
   President Donald Trump as the kind of American company his trade war
   was meant to protect, higher costs for steel and aluminum to make its
   bikes in the US has coincided with a demographic shift that favors big
   new markets in Asia, and fewer Americans buying Harleys.
   Harley-Davidson's CEO John Olin told investors, "We're looking at our
   business with an abundance of caution necessary in an environment like
   this." Harley wants to send some production to Thailand, to better
   capture the Asian and European markets.
   Some companies have seen disruption from tariffs that haven't even gone
   into effect yet.

   Hasbro (HAS), the maker of the board game Monopoly and Nerf toys, told
   investors Tuesday it may have to raise prices for games and toys, if a
   scheduled December 15 round of tariffs takes hold. Its CEO Brian
   Goldner: "If the December 15 tariffs were to take effect, we would take
   pricing to again protect our gross margin, and those price increases
   would be passed along to consumers."
   Of course, part of the strategy of the tariffs was to nudge companies
   to diversify their supply chains outside of China, and return
   production home. The president has said, if companies don't like
   tariffs, move back to the US. In some cases, that production is moving
   out of China, but to Vietnam and Thailand, among other places. Still,
   the president's trade advisers have said the overall economy is strong
   enough to absorb any disruptions from tariffs. They are looking for
   what insiders call a "course-correction" in the US-China trade
   relationship. Tariffs are the main tool for that. What CEOs would like
   clarity on is, how long will it last?
