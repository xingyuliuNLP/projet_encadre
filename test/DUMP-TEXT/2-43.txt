Foggy outlook
How the twists and turns of the trade war are hurting growth

   The IMF downgrades its forecasts for the global economy. Again

   HONG KONG

   AFTER WELCOMING the St Louis Blues, a championship-winning ice-hockey
   team, to the White House on October 15th, President Donald Trump fondly
   recalled a recent triumph of his own: last week‚Äôs tentative trade deal
   with China. Simply put, America will impose no further punitive tariffs
   on Chinese imports if China promises to buy American farm goods worth
   billions of dollars. How many billions? ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very big numbers,‚Äù Mr
   Trump emphasised. ‚ÄúI said, ‚ÄòAsk for 70.‚Äô‚Ä¶My people said, ‚ÄòAll right,
   make it 20.‚Äô I said, ‚ÄòNo, make it 50.‚Äô‚Äù

   Will this carefully calibrated amount ever materialise? China does not
   want to pay over the odds or deprive other, friendlier suppliers of its
   custom. It also wants America to go beyond promising no new tariffs and
   to start removing existing ones. The deal may unravel before it is
   written down, let alone signed by the two countries‚Äô leaders next month
   at the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum in Santiago.

   That unpredictability is a problem. Not just higher tariffs but
   ‚Äúprolonged trade-policy uncertainty‚Äù are damaging the world economy,
   said Gita Gopinath, the IMF‚Äôs chief economist, this week as the fund
   again cut its forecast for global growth. ‚ÄúManufacturing firms have
   become more cautious about long-range spending and have held back on
   equipment and machinery purchases,‚Äù the fund notes. The fog of trade
   war is depressing investment spending. And because machinery, equipment
   and other capital goods are often imported, weak investment spending is
   further hurting trade. The IMF now expects the world economy to expand
   by just 3% this year, compared with 3.6% last year. That would be the
   slowest rate in the decade since the global financial crisis.

   Both America and the euro zone are expected to grow more slowly this
   year than the fund had envisaged in July, before trade tensions
   escalated. India‚Äôs prospects have dimmed sharply: it is forecast to
   grow by 6.1% rather than the 7% expected only months ago. And in 2020
   China is now projected to expand by less than 6% for the first time in
   30 years.

   The fund has, unsurprisingly, slashed its forecast for Hong Kong. The
   city is now expected to grow by only 0.3%, compared with the 2.7%
   foreseen in April, before its economic prospects vanished in a cloud of
   tear-gas. The unrest could also jeopardise the fragile trade truce
   between America and China. On October 15th the House of Representatives
   passed a measure enjoining America to assess Hong Kong‚Äôs autonomy
   annually and sanction officials who violate it. China reacted angrily
   to what it describes as meddling in its affairs.

   The IMF‚Äôs economists have valiantly tried to quantify the damage to the
   world economy from the trade war if Mr Trump‚Äôs putative deal falls
   apart. The direct impact is surprisingly modest. The tariffs already in
   place and in the pipeline could reduce America‚Äôs GDP by just over 0.2%
   next year, compared with a world in which the trade war had never
   started (see chart). More harmful are indirect effects: weaker business
   confidence, productivity and risk-appetite on financial markets. These
   bring the damage to almost 0.6% of America‚Äôs GDP in 2020. The damage to
   China would be almost 2% of its GDP.

   These are small percentages‚Äîbut of vast economies. If the IMF is right,
   an unresolved trade war could cost America roughly $125bn of forgone
   output next year alone. The cost to China could exceed $300bn (at
   market exchange rates). Big numbers indeed. ‚ñ
