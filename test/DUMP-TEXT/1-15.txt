CALPUFF Modeling System

   CALPUFF is an advanced non-steady-state meteorological and air quality
   modeling system developed by scientists at Exponent, Inc. It is
   maintained by the model developers and distributed by Exponent. The
   model has been listed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
   as an alternative model for assessing long range transport of
   pollutants and their impacts on Federal Class I areas and for certain
   near-field applications involving complex meteorological conditions
   when the selection and use occur in agreement with the appropriate
   reviewing authority and approval by the EPA Regional Office (see
   details on CALPUFF's Regulatory Status).

   The modeling system consists of three main components and a set of
   preprocessing and post-processing programs. The main components of the
   modeling system are CALMET (a diagnostic three-dimensional
   meteorological model), CALPUFF (an air quality dispersion model), and
   CALPOST (a post-processing package). In addition to these components,
   there are numerous other processors that may be used to prepare
   geophysical (land use and terrain) data in many standard formats;
   meteorological data (surface, upper air, precipitation, and buoy data);
   and interfaces to other models such as the Penn State/NCAR Mesoscale
   Model (MM5), the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP)
   Eta/NAM and RUC models, the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF)
   model and the RAMS model.

   Some examples of applications for which CALPUFF may be suitable
   include:
     * Near-field impacts in complex flow or dispersion situations
          + Complex terrain
          + Stagnation, inversion, recirculation, and fumigation
            conditions
          + Overwater transport and coastal conditions
          + Light wind speed and calm wind conditions
     * Long-range transport
     * Visibility assessments and Class I area impact studies
     * Criteria pollutant modeling, including application to State
       Implementation Plan (SIP) development
     * Secondary pollutant formation and particulate matter modeling
     * Buoyant area and line sources (e.g., forest fires and aluminum
       reduction facilities)

Distribution of the CALPUFF Modeling System:

   The CALPUFF Modeling System is available from Exponent without charge.
   The main models (CALMET, CALPUFF, and CALPOST), and related processors

Updates

   October 1, 2019
   CALPUFF Version 7.3.1 has been released. This version incorporates an
   agricultural spraying source type. In addition, several bugs were
   identified and fixed in Version 7.2.1 including issues with the use of
   multiple sub-hourly variable emissions files and processing missing
   layers in AERMET generated .PFL files.

   The post-processors CALPOST (v7.2.0 to v7.3.0), CALSUM (v7.1.0 to
   v7.2.0) and POSTUTIL (v7.1.0 to v7.2.0) have also been updated to allow
   processing of the new spray source type.

   CALWRF has been updated from v2.0.2 to v2.0.3 to correct a bug related
   to precipitation events which cross between multiple WRFOUT files.

   July 26, 2016
   The USEPA has approved an update of CALMET and CALPUFF from V5.8.4
   (dated July 31, 2013) to V5.8.5 (dated December 14, 2015). This update
   includes code changes described in Model Change Bulletin H (MCB-H).
   These changes include fixes to bugs in the implementation of PRIME
   downwash, along with updates to eliminate specific compilation and list
   file errors.

   June 22, 2015
   CALPUFF Version 7 is released.

   March 19, 2014
   CALMET has been updated from v6.334 to v6.4.0 (level 121203). This
   update includes the enhancements of polar stereographic mapping,
   increased maximum number of 3D.DAT files, and a compressible liquid
   water content output file. In addition, several bugs were identified
   and fixed with v6.4.0 including improved time zone reads from input
   file headers, expanded input file version support, and updated logic
   for input file version assumptions.
   CALSUM has been updated from v1.4 to v1.5.0 (level 121203). This update
   allows files with different time periods to be merged. With the update,
   it is assumed that times missing from one of the compared CALPUFF files
   have zero impact from the sources contained in other comparison files.
   That is, concentrations are assumed zero for those periods not in an
   "addend" file. In addition, v1.5.0 expands the version string to 12
   characters.
   METSERIES has been updated from v1.81 to v1.9.0 (level 121203). This
   update includes the enhancements of inclusion of surface pressure as an
   output parameter, a more explicit midnight convention, support for
   extracting precipitation data from PRECIP.DAT and 2D.DAT formatted
   files, and support for reading newest format AERMOD files (SURFACE,
   PROFILE data). In addition a bug was fixed to correctly address missing
   data in wind rose calculations.
   SMERGE has been updated from v5.661 to v5.7.0 (level 121203). This
   update includes the enhancement of allowing more NCDC ISHWO data codes
   to be read. In addition, a bug was fixed to correctly address missing
   temperature observations and missing data flags.
   BUOY has been updated from v1.251 to v1.3.0 (level 140116). This
   updates adds an enhancement of read functionality for the standard NDBC
   data format available at the time of this update.
   Please note the updated programs above include the following two
   revised CALPUFF library files:
   CALUTILS (CALPUFF library) has been updated from v2.58 to v.2.6.0
   (level 140318). This update utilizes standard Fortran 95 intrinsic
   procedures for date and time (Subroutine DATETM). Obsolete compiler
   specific code removed for obtaining command line arguments (Subroutine
   COMLINE).
   COORDLIB (CALPUFF library) has been updated from v1.98 to v1.10.0
   (level 140313). This update fixes erroneous non-zero false Northing
   when converting Southern hemisphere locations to UTM-N coordinates.
   Also initialize various variables and work arrays to zero.

   December 4, 2013 The USEPA has approved an update of CALMET and CALPUFF
   from V5.8 (dated June 23, 2007) to V5.8.4 (dated July 31, 2013). This
   update includes USEPA-approved portions of code changes described in
   Model Change Bulletin E (MCB-E), MCB-F and MCB-G. USEPA has approved
   only those portions of the Model Change Bulletins that are recognized
   as bug fixes. All other code changes (enhancements and new features)
   are not included at this time. A memo describing bug fixes versus
   enhancements is available on SCRAM. Note that the USEPA approved
   version of CALPOST remains V6.221 (level 080724).

   August 13, 2013 CALWRF has been updated from v1.4 to v2.0.1 (level
   130418), which includes support to process multiple WRF files, a
   precipitation rate bug fix, creation of 2D.DAT files, range checks for
   2D/3D variables, 3D.DAT header correction, a map projection bug fix,
   blank string initialization routine, and idatenext loop bug fix, and
   updated Linux and Windows compiling instructions.

   August 17, 2012 The USEPA-Approved version of CALPOST has been updated
   from version 5.6394 (level 070622) to version 6.221 (level 080724).
   Version 6.221 includes "Method 8" (MVISBK = 8, M8_MODE = 5, MVISCHECK =
   1), which utilizes the revised IMPROVE equation per the Federal Land
   Managers' Air Quality Related Values Work Group (FLAG) revised October
   2010 report. This update only effects CALPOST, and no other program in
   the CALPUFF System of programs. The USEPA-Approved version of CALPUFF
   remains version 5.8 (level 070623) and the USEPA-Approved version of
   CALMET is still version 5.8 (level 070623).

   April 25, 2011. Version 6.42 of the model has been updated to
   include MCB-G.

   inorganic gas-particle equilibrium, addition of aqueous-phase
   transformation adapted from the RADM cloud implementation in
   CMAQ/SCICHEM and a new option for anthropogenic secondary organic
   aerosol (SOA) formation based on the CalTech SOA model implemented in
   CMAQ-MADRID. These changes are based on work by Karamchandani et al.
   (2008) with an earlier version of ISORROPIA and CALPUFF. Other changes
   in this release also include MCB-F updates as well as new model options
   such as a nested grid option in CALPUFF.

   August 4, 2008. An implementation of the draft FLAG (2008) guidance on
   visibility has been added to a new beta Version 6 of CALPOST. The GUI
   has been enhanced to include a library of the f(RH) and background
   extinction values for each Class I area in the United States. Changes
   to Version 6 of CALMET and CALPUFF that do not affect results when
   running in regulatory mode have been included in this update.
