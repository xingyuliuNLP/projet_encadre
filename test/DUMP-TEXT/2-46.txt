The US and China called a small ceasefire in their trade war. But the

   expert said.

   The smallest of openings in the US-China trade war has appeared,
   potentially signaling a break in tensions between the two nations.

   On Wednesday, Beijing released a list of 16 American products — such as
   livestock, grease, and cancer drugs — that would be exempt from new
   tariffs until September 2020. That won’t make a big impact on the US
   economy, but it looked like a promising sign headed into planned
   US-China trade negotiations next month.

   Then on Wednesday night, President Donald Trump seemingly reciprocated
   with his own “gesture of good will.” In two tweets, he announced the
   two-week delay of a 5 percent increase in tariffs, from 25 percent to
   30 percent, on $250 billion of Chinese goods originally scheduled for
   October 1. According to the president, he made this move at the request
   of China’s Vice Premier Liu He and also because the first day of next
   month is the 70th anniversary of the founding of the People’s Republic
   of China.

   Again, it’s not much, but it shows that Trump is willing to lessen some
   of the pressure in the trade war that he started.

   However, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin claims that Trump’s move is
   all part of a dealmaking strategy.

   “The president is a negotiator. And he is prepared to keep these
   tariffs in place, he’s prepared to raise tariffs if we need to raise
   tariffs,” he told CNBC on Thursday. He could do a deal any time. But he
   only wants to do a good deal.”

   So do Wednesday’s actions mean this is the beginning of the end of the
   trade war? Likely not.

“It suits both governments to have a bit of a breather right now”

   Jacob Kirkegaard, a global trade expert at the Peterson Institute for
   International Economics, told me that Beijing and Washington have yet
   to fundamentally change their overall stances on the trade war. China
   is fine striking a small deal with the US — reducing tariffs so it can
   buy large amounts of products again — while America wants the “big
   deal,” amounting to a complete restructuring of the trade dynamic
   between the two nations.

   Which means the small reduction in tensions this week doesn’t
   necessarily change the situation. But it does indicate both countries
   are eager for a slight and momentary reprieve.

   China is struggling with unrest in Hong Kong and has the anniversary
   celebration coming up, Kirkegaard said, while noting “Trump faces a
   slowing economy” and needs “people to stop talking about a recession.”
   This small ceasefire, then, gives both sides a needed break.

   “I think it suits both governments to have a bit of a breather right
   now,” Kirkegaard said.

   It’s unlikely the US and China will strike a comprehensive trade deal
   by the end of Trump’s first term, experts say, because officials in
   Beijing don’t trust Trump as a negotiating partner. They’re more likely
   to wait to see if Trump loses in 2020. Should he win, though, China may
   be forced to come to some sort of agreement with the president — or the
   destructive trade war will continue well into the future.
