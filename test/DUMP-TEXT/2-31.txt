   Paying the price: at a Black Friday sale in Niles, Illinois, November

   In late June, the leaders of China and the United States announced at
   the G-20 meeting in Osaka, Japan, that they had reached a détente in
   their trade war. U.S. President Donald Trump claimed that the two sides
   had set negotiations “back on track.” He put on hold new tariffs on
   Chinese goods and lifted restrictions preventing U.S. companies from
   selling to Huawei, the blacklisted Chinese telecommunications giant.
   Markets rallied, and media reports hailed the move as a “cease-fire.”

   That supposed cease-fire was a false dawn, one of many that have marked
   the on-again, off-again diplomacy between Beijing and Washington. All
   wasn’t quiet on the trade front; the guns never stopped blazing. In
   September, after a summer of heated rhetoric, the Trump administration
   increased tariffs on another $125 billion worth of Chinese imports.
   China responded by issuing tariffs on an additional $75 billion worth
   of U.S. goods. The United States might institute further tariffs in
   December, bringing the total value of Chinese goods subject to punitive
   tariffs to over half a trillion dollars, covering almost all Chinese
   imports. China’s retaliation is expected to cover 69 percent of its
   imports from the United States. If all the threatened hikes are put in
   place, the average tariff rate on U.S. imports of Chinese goods will be
   about 24 percent, up from about three percent two years ago, and that
   on Chinese imports of U.S. goods will be at nearly 26 percent, compared
   with China’s average tariff rate of 6.7 percent for all other
   countries.

   The parties to this trade war may yet step back from the abyss. There
   have been over a dozen rounds of high-level negotiations without any
   real prospect of a settlement. Trump thinks that tariffs will convince
   China to cave in and change its allegedly unfair trade practices. China
   may be willing to budge on some issues, such as buying more U.S. goods,
   opening its market further to U.S. companies, and improving
   intellectual property protection,
