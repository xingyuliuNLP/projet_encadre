Foreign tariffs hit home: 15 months into the US-Chinese trade war, Steamboat
outdoor companies are paying the consequences

   Steamboat Springs-based outdoor companies are affected by the
   U.S.-China trade war.
   Stock photo/Getty

   STEAMBOAT SPRINGS — Over the past two decades that Bill Gamber has run
   the local outdoor company Big Agnes, he did not think much about
   tariffs — the tax a government levies on various imports and exports.

   That changed about a year ago after tensions between the U.S. and China
   plunged both countries into a trade war. Now in its 15th month, the
   dispute has led the world’s two largest economies to impose millions of
   dollars in tariffs on one another. The list of products hit with new
   taxes has grown to include a wide array of thousands of goods ranging
   from furniture to vegetables to perfumes.

   Gamber’s company faces hundreds of thousands of dollars in price hikes
   due to the tariffs, and other Steamboat-based outdoor companies are
   grappling with similar financial blows.

Assessing the damage

   On July 6, 2018, the White House imposed the first tranche of new
   tariffs, imposing a 25% levy on $34 billion worth of Chinese goods.
   This came after President Donald Trump pledged to address “unfair”
   trade practices with the country and allegations China was stealing
   American intellectual property. Beijing retaliated with its own tariffs
   on about $34 billion worth of U.S. products.

   In a trade war, countries impose tariffs as a kind of economic
   firepower. But as in actual warfare, both sides suffer casualties, and
   friendly fire is almost inevitable.

   This year, Big Agnes has paid more than $500,000 in extra tariffs,
   according to Gamber. Next year, if the U.S. and China cannot reach a
   deal, he said his company could pay an extra $2 million to import all
   the goods it needs.

   Amid the debacle, Gamber has become an expert on tariff rates. He can
   list them from memory — both the old rates that remained largely
   unchanged for decades and the new, higher rates. Take the cost to
   import Big Agnes duffel bags. In previous years, Gamber’s company paid
   a 17% rate. Since the start of 2019, after the White House raised
   tariffs by almost a quarter of the previous percentage, the rate has
   risen to almost 43%, according to Gamber.

   The extent of future damage depends on whether the White House follows
   through on its plan to impose a further 15% tariff on almost all
   remaining Chinese imports including laptops, smartphone, footwear and
   clothing.

   Trump has backed away from tariffs in the past, sometimes just days
   before they were scheduled to take effect. On Oct. 11, he delayed rate
   hikes on more than $250 billion worth of Chinese goods after announcing
   he reached a “very substantial phase one deal” with Beijing to stop the
   trade war.

   The president’s rhetoric on the dispute, most of which surfaces through
   his Twitter posts, has real sway on local businesses.

   “When Trump sends a tweet, it can really cost us a lot,” Gamber said.

   It also impacts the larger national economy, particularly the health of
   the stock market.

   After reaching his “phase one deal,” Trump tweeted there were “warmer
   feelings” in U.S.-China trade talks. By that evening, when the stock
   market closed for the day, the S&P 500 snapped out of a three-week
   losing streak. Around the same time, consumer sentiment across the
   country improved, according to a survey from the University of
   Michigan.

The fear (and cost) of the unknown

   The Trump Administration’s contradictions in the trade war create
   uncertainty, not only for Americans like Gamber but for virtually every
   economy in the world that in some way does business with the U.S. or
   China.

   Christine Lagard, who will soon head the European Central Bank,
   discussed how such uncertainty can become a contagion to global
   economic growth during a “60 Minutes” interview that aired Sunday, Oct.
   20.

   “It’s the unknown which is hurting, because you can’t adjust to the
   unknown,” she told CBS News’ John Dickerson. “So what do you do? You
   build buffers. You build savings. You wonder what comes next. That’s
   not propitious to economic development.”

   This week, experts at the International Monetary Fund estimated the
   U.S.-China dispute will slow global growth to 3% in 2019, the slowest
   pace in a decade.

   Similar to larger national economies, small businesses like Big Agnes
   rely on the predictability of financial projections to plan for the
   future. When a single tweet from the president can determine whether or
   not millions of dollars of tariffs take effect, Gamber no longer knows
   how hard his company will be hit, or how to plan for the fallout.

Far-reaching consequences

   Other Steamboat-based outdoor companies have suffered price increases
   from the trade war, even if they do not work directly with Chinese
   companies.

   Moots Cycles, a local bicycle manufacturer, gets most of its materials,
   namely titanium for bike frames, from the U.S., according to inventory
   manager Elyse Tanner.

   But many of the raw materials that go into making tires, pedals and
   other parts at one point go through a Chinese factory. Now it is nearly
   impossible to do anything without using a product that has a “Made in
   China” stamp on it. The companies that provide Moots with these
   materials, even those based in the U.S., have raised the cost of these
   goods in reaction to the trade war.

   “They are getting hit with fees and passing it onto us,” Tanner said.

   John Weinman, owner of the Classic Crank Bicycle Shoppe, has seen a
   similar trickle-down effect among his suppliers. He expects those
   companies, which sell him the steel, tires and other equipment he uses
   to build vintage bikes, to face a 25% increase in costs by next year.

   While he hopes those larger wholesale companies will not pass the cost
   onto him, Weinman is bracing for the worst.

   “I’ve started telling people to be prepared to see significant
   increases,” he said.

Looking for solutions

   As goods from China get more expensive, some companies are looking
   elsewhere to source their products.

   In the future, Big Agnes will make all of its furniture line in South
   Korea, according to Gamber. But for other, more specialized products,
   China remains one of the only countries with the manufacturing
   infrastructure to meet demand.

   “There is hardly a supply chain outside of China to make sleeping
   bags,” he said.

   Moving factories elsewhere would jeopardize the quality and innovation
   of products, according to Gamber.

   His company also has long-lasting partnerships in the Asian country.
   Some of his suppliers have manufactured products for Big Agnes ever
   since its founding 20 years ago. When representatives from these
   Chinese companies visit Steamboat, Gamber often has dinner with them or
   shares a few runs at Steamboat Resort.

   “It’s not like it’s this cold, dark factory that you don’t have a
   relationship with,” Gamber said. “We’ve developed some real
   friendships.”

   For now, none of the Steamboat companies interviewed plan to raise
   their prices to make up for any lost revenue. As Gamber explained,
   fluctuating costs can cause just as much anxiety for consumers as for
   suppliers, and he does not want to lose customers. He and his staff are
   trying to be as savvy as possible to keep the consequences of the
   tariffs at bay.

   Good news may be on the horizon.

   After reaching the “phase one deal” with China on Oct. 11, Trump told
   reporters at the White House, “There was a lot of friction between the
   U.S. and China and now it’s a lovefest.” Many see that as a sign he may
   cancel the next tariff hike scheduled for Dec. 15.

   Gamber just hopes the love can last.
