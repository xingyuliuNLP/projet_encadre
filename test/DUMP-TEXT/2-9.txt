   Highlights

   If the tariffs the U.S. and China have applied against one another
   remain in place for the rest of the year, the direct, short-term
   macroeconomic consequences in either country are likely to be
   minimal--unless household and business confidence tanks. That said, the
   more profound risks may lurk elsewhere.

   A meaningful slowdown in U.S. domestic demand from the trade dispute
   may lead to rate cuts. The Federal Reserve is in wait-and-see mode, but
   the chance of an "insurance" rate cut has increased.

   For China, the key risk is that the combined effects of investment
   restrictions, export controls, and tariffs will rewire supply chains
   and weaken manufacturing investment, particularly in the technology
   sectors driving growth.

   In Europe, the direct effects of U.S. - China trade friction will be
   felt in sectors with medium to high technological content like
   transport equipment, motor vehicles, rubber and plastics, chemical
   products, and pharmaceuticals.

   The indirect effects in Europe could be more detrimental, not least
   because it is increasingly dependent on trade, unlike China, and much
   more dependent than the U.S.

   China, May. 22 2019 -- In a first look at trade tariffs the U.S. and
   China have recently slapped on each other, economists at S&P Global
   Ratings believe the direct effects on the world's two largest economies
   are likely to be minimal--if the levies remain in place for the rest of
   2019. However, the indirect macroeconomic effects are likely to be
   many, varied, and capture other trade-dependent economies in their nets
   like Europe and Canada. Beyond the macro level, the direct hits on
   specific sectors, lower-income consumers, and small and midsize
   enterprises (SMEs) with exposure to tariffs are likely to be sizable.

   The U.S. Is Still Weathering The Storm

   While the trade war brewing between the U.S. and China will likely have
   minimal direct macroeconomic effects on either country in the near
   future, the longer-term consequences for global supply chains, U.S.
   business sentiment, and consumers' purchasing power are growing.

   For now, S&P Global Ratings' economists believe the increase in tariffs
   laid out by U.S. President Donald Trump will boost overall U.S.
   consumer price inflation modestly--even companies such as Walmart and
   Macy's are warning that shoppers will almost certainly soon pay higher
   prices.

   This will help bring the overall inflation reading closer to the U.S.
   Federal Reserve's target. However, the Fed would likely see any
   increase in inflation caused by a one-off increase in tariff rates as
   temporary. However, a meaningful slowdown in domestic demand from the
   trade dispute will likely lead to rate cuts. For now, the central bank
   is in wait-and-see mode, but the chance of an "insurance" rate cut has
   increased.

   We expect the 25% tariffs, combined with reciprocal retaliation from
   China, if they hold for the year, will directly shave off only about 30
   basis points from growth in the next 12 months but perhaps a bit more
   in secondary effects such as tighter financial conditions and increased
   uncertainty reducing business appetite for investment. While that will
   slow growth, it is not enough to threaten recession in the world's
   largest economy.

   Typically, U.S. strategy in such a dispute is to force a trade partner
   to drop restraints on American goods, raise the value of its currency
   (thus making U.S. products more competitive), or to buy some time to
   reach certain domestic production capacity levels. And some economists
   espouse the view that U.S. tariffs on China could have longer-term
   benefits if they lead, for example, to a further opening of its
   financial services and insurance markets to American entities. The
   question is whether this reward offsets the risk (see "Global Trade At
   A Crossroads: U.S. And China Exchange Tariff Blows," published May 14,
   2019, on RatingsDirect).

   Though headlines focus on tariffs on goods, the real story is on less
   tangible issues such as reaching an agreement on reciprocal bilateral
   investment opportunities, intellectual property protection, and level
   playing fields for domestic and foreign firms. The question has always
   been: Will U.S. levers on China, such as investment restrictions,
   export controls and, to a lesser extent, tariffs lead to a new
   strategic economic dialogue between the two titans? The worry is that
   stubbornness will win the day.

   The tariffs that the U.S. and China have levied cover a wide range of
   products, with most focused on the manufacturing sector (see chart 1).
   This time, the U.S. extended tariffs to consumer products, so
   households will suffer higher prices at the mall, and the U.S.
   farmer--the poster child when it comes to trade wars--will take yet
   another blow to his bottom line.

   [easset_upload_file1494_1022321_e.png]

   Either way, SMEs tend to suffer more from tariffs and other trade
   barriers than large multinational firms do, with profit margins
   squeezed by rising costs. To the extent that businesses can pass on
   these costs, consumers would see rising prices, with low-income
   households suffering the most.

   We expect a modest increase in consumer prices of 20-30 basis points
   (bps). Still, that would erase, at least partially, the boost that last
   year's tax cuts gave to households' spending power--with the average
   family of four facing a roughly $2,200 increase in annual costs,
   according to a study from consulting firm the Trade Partnership
   Worldwide.

   Compared with a no-tariff baseline, the 25% tariffs on $200 billion of
   Chinese imports, combined with retaliation by China, would likely shave
   off 30 bps from U.S. GDP growth in the next 12 months. But to better
   understand the potential economic effects of the current dispute,
   consider that when the Obama Administration increased levies on tires
   from China in 2009, the Chinese government retaliated with significant
   tariffs on U.S. poultry, which, according to one estimate, shaved $1
   billion from U.S. poultry exports.

   In similar fashion, Chinese buyers recently canceled a large order for
   American pork, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and
   American farmers' fears of a significant hit are making headlines. The
   earlier $12 billion bailout package the White House put together for
   all farmers has reportedly done little to cushion the blow. Many also
   view a new bailout proposal of $15 billion to $20 billion as a day late
   and a dollar short.

   The secondary effects of potential financial market volatility, too,
   pose a downside risk to our growth forecast. Investors have proven to
   be sensitive to heightened political and economic uncertainty, and the
   effects on already slow business investment could be significant. Add
   to this potential job losses in certain industries--with many American
   jobs at risk because of U.S. and Chinese tariffs--and it's clear that
   the escalation in tensions between the two countries will have notable
   real-world ramifications.

   Implicit in our calculation is that U.S. importers will bear the full
   costs of the tariffs, that domestic producers step up supply--with a
   full pass-through of cost to consumers--and that the tariffs are not
   short-lived. In reality, these assumptions wouldn't necessarily hold
   true for all products in the same way, and price changes would vary by
   degree of reliance on Chinese imports. Moreover, while American farmers
   would lose export business, higher supply at home would drive down
   domestic prices. The effect on prices also depends on the so-called
   "elasticity" of demand for a product. The more elastic a product, the
   more easily shoppers can find a substitute. Moreover, businesses may
   decide to eat the extra cost rather than risk losing market share,
   under the assumption that the tariffs will be short-lived.

   Fed policymakers, too, would likely view any increase in inflation as
   temporary. However, a meaningful slowdown in domestic demand could lead
   the central bank to lower its benchmark interest rates. For now, the
   Fed is in wait-and-see mode, but the chance of an "insurance" rate cut
   has increased.

   This comes as the U.S. deficit is growing. Government spending likely
   gave American households and businesses a near-term incentive to
   consume. Given that the output gap is positive, and with no meaningful
   supply-driven boost to growth expected from fiscal spending, this
   likely means a lift to consumption with only modest productivity gains.
   The stronger economy also signals a higher dollar, meaning more money
   could end up overseas, purchasing relatively cheaper products than in
   the U.S. and adding to an already wide trade deficit.

   At a time when the world's biggest economy is at or near full
   employment, and the output gap is positive, we expect increased
   spending from tax reform and the bipartisan budget agreement will widen
   the deficit to $1.2 trillion by next year.

   For China, Weaker Manufacturing Investment Is A Warning Sign

   At any rate, the latest tariff hikes are just a small manifestation of
   wider trade and investment frictions. While the direct hit from higher
   U.S. levies is unlikely to jeopardize China's outlook for the next year
   or so, the effects on household and business confidence are a wildcard
   that may amplify the short-term hit, with more profound risks lurking
   elsewhere. In particular, together with other manifestations of
   friction--including investment and export restrictions--the risks of
   disruptions to China's supply chains in the medium term are rising,
   particularly in technology sectors.

   However, we don't see much movement in China's macro needle coming
   directly from tariffs. We estimate that China's value-added exports to
   the U.S. accounted for a little more than 3% of GDP last year. In turn,
   we estimate that the direct effects of the latest round of tariff hikes
   will shave just 0.1 percentage point from China's GDP in the next 12
   months.

   Our estimate assumes that Chinese exporters fully pass the tariffs on
   and that U.S. consumers--both firms and households--will be slow to
   find substitutes for higher-priced Chinese goods. (Specifically, we
   assume real demand will fall by half the incremental tariff hike, or
   7.5%.) We also assume that China's value-added share of exports to the
   U.S, which nets out parts that China imports from other countries, is
   about 90%. China's retaliatory tariff increases are unlikely to change
   this picture, given that they affect only $60 billion of imports from
   the U.S.

   The short-term effect on China's economy may be amplified if higher
   tariffs weaken confidence and reduce spending by firms and households.
   Softer household spending growth in recent quarters has turned the
   focus on the consumer, but we think the impact on firms' investment
   plans are more important. Expected future returns on capital are likely
   to be highly sensitive to not only the level of tariffs but also the
   lingering uncertainty surrounding trade policies.

   Manufacturing investment should be a key focus. Manufacturing
   investment growth, particularly in sectors exposed to
   tariffs--including electrical machinery and computer equipment--had a
   weak start this year (see chart 2). Investment in the electrical
   machinery sector for the year to April is now falling compared to the
   same period last year--the first time this has ever happened since at
   least 2004. Lower investment would mean a larger short-term demand hit
   to the economy, with manufacturing accounting for about 30% of total
   fixed-asset investment and more than 20% of China's GDP.

   [easset_upload_file58261_1022321_e.png]

   Weaker manufacturing investment would affect jobs and potential output.
   If manufacturing investment growth for the full year were to fall to
   just under 3%--from near 10% last year and close to recent mid-2016
   lows--this would trim a further 1 percentage point off GDP growth. This
   would also likely lead to job losses in manufacturing, hurting
   household incomes and consumption. Note that the purchasing managers'
   reading on manufacturing employment is already at a seven-year low.
   Weaker manufacturing investment would also lower future output
   capacity, particularly in the faster-growing technology sectors of the
   economy.

   While the risks of a pronounced investment slowdown are rising, we
   expect a gradual adjustment in firms' investment plans. The
   implications of weaker manufacturing investment are serious, but we
   don't expect a hard landing for capital spending, unless financial
   conditions also tightened substantially. Given that many manufacturers
   are from the private sector, which sometime find it more difficult to
   borrow during times of stress, this isn't a trivial risk. Still, we
   expect the effect on manufacturing investment to be gradual as firms
   take time to diversify their supply-chain risks--even as finding
   alternatives to the scale and sophistication of China's manufacturing
   ecosystems will be hard.

   For China's policymakers, we think they can offset the direct effect of
   tariffs without resorting to major stimulus. We estimate that allowing
   the real effective exchange rate to decline by 2%-3% would improve
   China's competitiveness and take care of much of the hit to net
   exports--this depreciation is, of course, already happening. The
   renminbi may have to weaken somewhat more against the U.S. dollar if
   the currencies of partners that participate in China's supply chain
   also depreciate. If policymakers wish to avoid the currency carrying
   the full burden of adjustment, they could combine depreciation with
   moderate fiscal stimulus.

   If the effects on manufacturing investment and household spending
   amplify the direct effects, more stimulus would likely be required if
   the government wants to keep official GDP growth above 6%. There are
   few good options here. While taxes could be cut again, firms and
   consumers may decide to save rather than spend the proceeds, given an
   uncertain outlook. The historically reliable option would be more
   infrastructure investment and relaxed housing market policies, all
   facilitated by an easing in credit. This would likely prove effective
   in the short term, but by adding to well-known vulnerabilities, it
   would clearly erode the government's room for maneuver down the road.

   Our broader view remains that while the short-term effects of higher
   U.S. tariffs are manageable for China, the longer-term ramifications
   for growth are more serious and largely underestimated. This is more a
   supply than a demand shock. The technology sector is where the combined
   effects of investment restrictions, export controls, and tariffs will
   be felt. And it's on technology and its ability to raise China's
   stumbling productivity growth that the country's prospects for a smooth
   rebalancing depend (see "A New Great Game--China, The U.S., And
   Technology," published May 14, 2019).

   Europe Is Not Immune

   At first glance, it appears that the European economy has more to fear
   from Chinese retaliation against American exports than from U.S.
   tariffs on Chinese goods and services. This is because the share of
   European content in U.S. production is twice as high as it is in
   Chinese production. This sharp difference is no surprise, once we
   consider that the opening of the Chinese economy is a recent
   development compared to the historical links that tie the European and
   U.S. economies.

   For the EU as a whole, involvement in U.S. and Chinese production
   represents a bit more than $400 billion, or 2.4% of GDP. The European
   sectors that are most exposed--that is, those whose involvement in U.S.
   and Chinese production far exceed the EU average--are transport
   equipment, motor vehicles, rubber and plastics, chemical products, and
   pharmaceuticals. All of these sectors have medium to high technological
   content. So, countries such as Germany, France, the U.K., and some
   Nordic nations will see the direct effects of U.S.-China trade
   friction.

   The indirect effects could be more detrimental, not least because the
   European economy is increasingly dependent on trade, unlike China, and
   much more dependent on trade than the U.S. (see chart 3). The world's
   two biggest national economies are also the two biggest trading
   partners for the EU, with the sum of EU trade (both exports and
   imports) with the two countries representing 8% of EU GDP.

   [easset_upload_file63014_1022321_e.png]

   If a rise in U.S. and Chinese protectionism dampens long-term
   growth--via the indirect channels of confidence and asset-price
   volatility weighing on capital formation--European trade will suffer.
   As the slowdown in Europe's GDP growth in the second half of last year
   made clear, the region's economy relies on world trade dynamics. For
   many European economies, trade carries almost as much weight as
   domestic activity. For eurozone countries, the average rate of economic
   openness (the sum of exports and imports relative to GDP) is close to
   37%--10 percentage points higher than in the U.S.

   At the corporate level, the U.S.-China dispute could lead European
   companies to rethink their global processes. Companies of the region
   went global in two waves: First in the 1990s to take advantage of lower
   labor costs by extending the value chain to emerging markets in Eastern
   Europe, Eastern Asia, and Latin America; and then about a decade later,
   to take advantage of rising demand in China and the U.S. This led to
   complex European value chains, which need several factors to work well
   for them to be optimal: not only labor costs and demand, but also taxes
   and tariffs. A change in the U.S.-China relationship may alter the
   geographical organization of some European industrial processes.

   And Europe Can't Free Ride The Trade Dispute

   It is probably fair to say that the trade interests of Europe align
   more with those of the U.S. than those of China. The continent shares
   questions with the U.S. like access to the Chinese market, ensuring a
   level playing field for European companies, and controlling the
   transfer of European technologies in Chinese acquisitions. Only the
   content of strategic technologies to be protected differs between the
   U.S. and Europe.

   Concretely, the industrial strategy China is following in developing
   key industrial sectors could elevate the country as a direct competitor
   to core European industries such as renewable energy equipment,
   industrial robots, and high-performance medical devices. China's
   molting from main export destination for European production to main
   competitor requires a strategic response that forces Europe to rethink
   its economic policy.

   Until now, the monitoring of free and fair competition has been at the
   heart of European economic policy. But faced with China's industrial
   ambitions, policymakers are starting to debate whether and how Europe
   should protect itself from Chinese acquisitions, and whether Europe
   should adopt an industrial policy aimed at developing European
   champions. It will be necessary to wait until after the European
   elections later in May and the formation of a new European Commission
   to know the future direction of the continent's economic governance.
   But it already seems clear that protection of European technological
   prowess would be more easily acceptable to the EU-28 than an all-out
   industrial policy, whose effectiveness has often been questioned and
   that would require agreeing on economic sectors to prioritize. If we
   think of the lack of success of the "Lisbon agenda," which aimed to
   make the EU the world's leading power in terms of information
   technology, it is fair to say that the region's track record regarding
   industrial policy is not an argument for renewed European industrial
   dirigisme.

   Moreover, Europe follows its own commercial and financial drummer,
   which makes it likely to favor the U.S. side only somewhat. In fact, an
   initiative launched by European Commission President Jean-Claude
   Juncker last year is looking at ways to strengthen the
   internationalization of the euro to protect Europe's interests against
   the extraterritoriality of U.S. laws.Can Canada Capitalize?

   North of the U.S., the escalation of the U.S.-China dispute could help
   certain manufacturers and suppliers, as U.S. buyers look for domestic
   substitutes, or those from suppliers in a third country. Since the U.S.
   buys machinery and plastics from both Canadian and Chinese exporters,
   the new tariffs could divert trade in favor of Canadian suppliers. A
   U.N. study suggests countries not directly hit with bilateral tariffs
   benefit most from trade diversion, and sees Canada's exports to the
   U.S. jumping as much as $20 billion.

   The bad news is that Canada will likely suffer collateral damage as the
   tariffs sour business sentiment and put planned investment at
   risk--though there will probably be little effect on Canadian GDP
   growth, according to Rob Palombi, S&P Global Ratings' Canadian Chief
   Economist.

   However, we do see direct effects on countries that have a high share
   of exports to China, such as Chile and Peru, as the renminbi weakens
   and Chinese demand slows--and some of this has already played out.
   Chilean copper exports fell 8% in the first quarter, and Peru's exports
   of the commodity metal tumbled more than 15%. To be sure, there is a
   price effect at play--but copper exports also contracted marginally in
   volume terms. At the same time, fixed investment contracted in nearly
   every Latin American economy in the fourth quarter of last year and the
   first three months of 2019. S&P Global Ratings' Latin American Senior
   Economist Elijah Oliveros-Rosen thinks the trade dispute, if it lasts,
   will continue to weigh on fixed investment through year-end.
