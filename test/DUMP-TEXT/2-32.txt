    A lot of growth in US economy & stock market can be attributed to EMs:
       Mark Mobius17 Dec, 2019, 10.58AM IST
       In the last 15 years, with a few exceptions, emerging markets have
       underperformed the US market. But a lot of US growth is EM growth.

       "We are seeing tentative signs of stabilisation, with the decline
       in manufacturing and trade appearing to have bottomed out. The
       announcement of a trade deal between the US and China reduced
       likelihood of a no-deal Brexit and the significant policy stimulus

       the top IMF official said.
